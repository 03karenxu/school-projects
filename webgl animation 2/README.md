**Date completed: November 6th, 2023**

Second assignment for my graphics class. Exercise in WebGL fragment shading, texture use, shader effects, modelling, and camera manipulation. Files in the Common directory and object.js were provided by the teaching staff.

**TO RUN:**
main.html must be served through a local server. 

1. In command line, navigate the directory containing main.html and enter
```
   $ python -m http.server
```
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8000 on your web browser.

**OUTPUT:**
main.html contains the resulting animation when opened as specified. The video does not loop and continues until the file is closed.
