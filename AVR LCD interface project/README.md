Assignment for my computer architecture class. Objectives specified in the assignment writeup were:

*  Use multiple AVR 16-bit timers.
*  Write interrupt handlers for two timers.
*  Output a representation of program state onto the Arduino mega2560 board’s 2x16 LCD display.
*  Practice with writing code the implements (and using functions that depend
upon) the parameter-passing mechanism based on stack frames.

**STRUCTURE:**

The assignment consists of four parts:

1. Part A - Write code to show on the LCD panel whether or not a button is currently being pressed.
2. Part B - Write code to show on the LCD panel which of four buttons (left, up, down, right) is either being pressed, or if there is no button being pressed, which button was last pressed.
3. Part C - Write code to permit the use of the “up” and “down” buttons to set a hexadecimal digit at the top-left of the LCD display.
4. Part D - Write code to extend your work in Part C such that using the “right” and “left” buttons will permit the “up”/”down” buttons to work in a different part of the display’s top row.
