**README**

**Date completed: October 16th, 2023**

First WebGL assignment for my graphics class. Exercise in hierarchical modelling and real-time animation in the GPU pipeline. Files in the common directory, object.js, and the vertex shader were provided by the teaching staff.

**OUTPUT:**

main.html - when opened, shows a 512x512 animation (plays immediately).
